C++ Command Line game: Jump over the snakes to win!

This project was the last project in my first CS course in college.  It is a command line game where you must jump over snakes to win!  To play the game, download the source code and compile in the command line or within your IDE.  I have had best results with formatting for the game within the command line.  Users running the game in Visual Studio will not see all past history for their moves.
