C++ Command Line game: Jump over the snakes to win!

This project was the last project in my first CS course in college.  It is a command line game where you must jump over snakes to win!  To play the game, download the source code and compile in the command line or within your IDE.  I have had best results with formatting for the game within the command line.  Users running the game in Visual Studio will not see all past history for their moves.  If running the game in Visual Studio, remember to select the CONSOLE subsystem in Settings.  Otherwise, the game will potentially flash on the screen and disappear.  This issue does not occur in Xcode or in the command line.  If running the game in Xcode, I suggest you increase the size of the console window to better see your history as the game progresses.
